## Methodology
The methodology of the **Log Out** project follows a structured approach to ensure comprehensive analysis:

1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Obtaining the dataset from Kaggle or other sources.  
   - Ensuring the dataset includes all relevant fields such as time spent on apps, addiction levels, and productivity metrics.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
   - Handling missing or inconsistent data using Python and SQL.  
   - Filtering and formatting data for accurate analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Understanding distributions, patterns, and correlations between variables.  
   - Identifying trends in social media usage and its impact on productivity.

4. **Visualization:**  
   - Creating interactive dashboards and charts in Power BI.  
   - Plotting graphs and statistical visualizations using Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.

5. **Insights & Recommendations:**  
   - Summarizing key findings from the analysis.  
   - Providing actionable recommendations to optimize screen time and enhance productivity.
